Description: Numerical and graphical analyses are provided to reproduce the 
  numerical demonstration of the local stability analysis for three species of 
  competing mosquito species with delayed maturity as supplementary material for
  the article "Stability of difference equations with interspecific density 
  dependence, competition, and maturation delays".
